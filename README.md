# decarbnow

Maintained git repository [here](https://github.com/decarbnow/website).

Our #decarbnow map brings climate activism and satellite data together. We visualize NO2 pollution hotspots based on [data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/OMNO2d_003/summary). In the future we also aim to visualize other satellite data in order to draw a more complete picture of the climate situation. On this map, digital climate activists can register and pinpoint polluters, climate transitions and climate action. At this moment, this can be done with the use of Twitter, but we want to make it available to other social media platforms soon. 

#decarbnow is work in progress. It was developed during the [NASA SpaceAppsChallenge 2019](https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/). Find the map hosted on [decarbnow.space](https://decarbnow.space) and stay tuned for updates.
