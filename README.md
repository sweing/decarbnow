# decarbnow
The #decarbnow map brings climate activism and satellite data together. We visualize NO2 pollution hotspots based on NASA OMI satellite data. In the future we also aim to visualize other pollution data in order to have. On this map, digital climate activists can register and pinpoint polluters, climate transitions and climate action. At this moment, this can be done with the use of Twitter, but in the future we want to make it available to other social media platforms as well. 

#decarbnow is work in progress. It was developed during the [NASA SpaceAppsChallenge 2019](https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/). Find the map hosted on [decarbnow.space](https://decarbnow.space) and stay tuned for updates.
