            <p>Our #decarbnow map brings climate activism and satellite data together. We visualize NO2 pollution hotspots based on data from the <a href="https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/OMNO2d_003/summary">NASA Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)</a>. In the future we also aim to visualize other satellite data in order to draw a more complete picture of the climate situation. On this map, digital climate activists can register and pinpoint polluters, climate transitions and climate action. At this moment, this can be done with the use of Twitter, but we want to make it available to other social media platforms soon.</p>
            <p>With this map, we want to draw a stronger, visible connection between data and climate activism on a local and global level. We believe this can catalyze social movement and enable more people to participate in climate action. First of all, users of our map will be able to see pollution hotspots, while having the ability to locate polluters close to those hotspots. Furthermore, climate action can be mapped as well which provides the ability for those actions to raise momentum. Finally, by making climate transition initiatives visible, we want to accelerate the transition to a green economy and decarbonize faster.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, we hope that our map can help to increase climate activism online and we believe that this can be done in a way that based on democratic technology, trustworthy data and persistent activism.</p>
            <p>#decarbnow is work in progress. It was developed during the <a href="https://www.spaceappschallenge.org">NASA SpaceAppsChallenge</a> 2019.</p>
